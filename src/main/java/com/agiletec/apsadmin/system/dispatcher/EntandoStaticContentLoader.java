/**
 * <b>Entando implementation of struts static content loader</b>
 * This class is used to serve common static content needed when using various parts of Struts, such as JavaScript
 * files, CSS files, etc. It works by looking for requests to /struts/* (or /static/*), and then mapping the value after "/struts/"
 * to common packages in Struts and, optionally, in your class path.
 * This class extends the Static loader of Struts2 to manage null path prefixes.
